#Challenge 1 :
# Write a function that finds the maximum product of two integers in an array
# For example, consider array {-10, -3, 5, 6, -2}. The maximum product is the (-10, -3) or (5, 6) pair.


# Challenge 2 :
# Write a function that returns the majority element if present, given an integer array containing duplicate
# For example, the majority element is 2 in array {2, 8, 7, 2, 2, 5, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2}


# Challenge 3 :
# Create a function that moves all zeros present in an array it to the end 
# The solution should maintain the relative order of items in the array


# Challenge 4 :
# Given a string s and an integer array indices of the same length.
# The string s will be shuffled such that the character at the ith position moves to indices[i] in the shuffled string.
# Return the shuffled string.
# Example:
# Input: s = "aaiougrt", indices = [4,0,2,6,7,3,1,5]
# Output: "arigatou"



# Challenge 5:
# Given two string arrays word1 and word2, return true if the two arrays represent the same string, and false otherwise.
# A string is represented by an array if the array elements concatenated in order forms the string.
# Example :
# Input: word1  = ["abc", "d", "defg"], word2 = ["abc","ddefg"]
# word1 represents string "abc" + "d"+ "defg" -> "abcddefg"
# word2 represents string "abc" + "ddefg" -> "abcddefg"
# Output: true
