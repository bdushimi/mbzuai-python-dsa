#10 Warm up Challenges

# Challenge 1:
# Write a program that prints out all the elements of the list "numbers" that are less than 5.
numbers = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]


#Challenge 2:
#Write a Python program which will return true if the two given integer values are equal or their sum or difference is 5.


#Challenge 3:
#Write a Python program to compute the distance between the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2)

#Challenge 4:
# Define a function named count that takes a single parameter. 
# The parameter is a string. The string will contain a single word divided into syllables by hyphens, such as these: "ba-na-na", "Data", "me-ta"
# Your function should count the number of syllables and return it.
# The call count("ho-tel") should return 2


#Challenge 5:
# Define a function named up_down that takes a single number as its parameter. 
# Your function return a tuple containing two numbers; the first should be one lower than the parameter, and the second should be one higher.
# For example, calling up_down(0) should return (-1, 1).


#Challenge 6:
#Define a function named consecutive_zeros that takes a single parameter, which is the string of zeros and ones
#Your function should return the number of consecutive zeros in the string.
#For instance, with this input "1001101000110", the function will return 3.

#Challenge 7:
# Write a Python program to check whether variable is integer or string or float.


#Challenge 8:
# Write a Python program to count and display the vowels of a given text.


#Challenge 9:
#Write a Python program to count the occurrences of each characher in a given sentence

#Challenge 10:
# Write a Python program which solve the equation:
# ax+by=c
# dx+ey=f
# Print the values of x, y where a, b, c, d, e and f are given.
